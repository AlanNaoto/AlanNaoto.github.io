<p><a href="http://carla.org/">CARLA</a> is an open-source autonomous vehicle driving suite built on top of 
Unreal Engine 4 which provides a Python API to manage the simulations. In this repo, I built a data
collector on top of it, which spawns vehicles, pedestrians, and sensors (RGB, 2D bounding box and 
depth), changes the weather conditions, and records all this data into a single HDF5 file.</p>

<p>With the data recorded from this repo, one can <strong>build their own private dataset</strong> to train a 
machine learning model :blush:</p>
