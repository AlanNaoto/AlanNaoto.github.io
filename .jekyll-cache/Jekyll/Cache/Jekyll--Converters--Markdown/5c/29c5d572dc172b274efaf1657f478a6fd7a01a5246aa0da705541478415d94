<p>Hello! I am a masterâ€™s double degree student on Electrical Engineering and 
International Automotive Engineering by Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (Brazil) and Technische 
Hochschule Ingolstadt (Germany). Iâ€™ve already worked on programming electrical power systems 
simulations, and currently am working on machine learning projects applied on the automotive
industry. Feel free to get in touch with me at ##put-link## :)  # TODO link</p>
