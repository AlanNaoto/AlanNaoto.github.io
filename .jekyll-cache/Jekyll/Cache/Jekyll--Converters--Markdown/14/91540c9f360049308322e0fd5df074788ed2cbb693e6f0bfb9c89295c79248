<p>When deploying machine learning models to the real world, specially in resource constrained environments, 
then model size and complexity plays a big role into determining itâ€™s usability, i.e.: will it make
predictions that are correct and also in a reasonable time?</p>

<p>In order to have an idea of the impact that your hardware has on the object detection task, Iâ€™m presenting to you
a benchmark on a set of 1600 frames with the following hardware:</p>
