## Some stuff
Hello! I am a master's double degree student on Electrical Engineering and 
International Automotive Engineering by Federal University of Paran√° (Brazil) and Technische 
Hochschule Ingolstadt (Germany). I've already worked on programming electrical power systems 
simulations, and currently am working on machine learning projects applied on the automotive
industry. Feel free to get in touch with me at ##put-link## :)  # TODO link
