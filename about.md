# Hey there!

I'm currently a research assistant at CARISSMA Forschungszentrum, developing AI projects in 
cooperation with the automotive industry. At the same time, I'm finishing my master's double degree 
between Federal University of Parana (Brazil) and Technische 
Hochschule Ingolstadt (Germany) on electrical and international automotive engineering.

In my spare time I enjoy building and sharing some of my programs and data exploration cases with 
the community. Feel free to take a look around!

Alan
